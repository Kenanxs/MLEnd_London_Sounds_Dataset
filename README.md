# MLEnd_London_Sounds_Dataset
Mini project on MLEnd London Sounds Dataset 

1. Basic Machine Learning Pipeline on MLEnd London Sounds Dataset
This notebook will be using the MLEnd London sounds dataset, to build a machine learning pipeline that takes an audio segment as an input and predicts whether the audio segment has been recorded indoors or outdoors.

2. Advanced Machine Learning Pipeline on MLEnd London Sounds Dataset
This notebook will be using the MLEnd London sounds dataset, to build a machine learning pipeline that takes an audio segment as an input and predicts which area the audio segment was recorded in.
